# Vengeance
### A problem that inspired me to take up coding, a problem which I was not solve then. Implemented in all programming languages I learn. 


The problem goes something like this:
>  Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1,2,â€¦,9 (in this order) such that the result is 100.
>  For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.

In hindsight I would say this is a pretty easy problem. But I was a different man a month ago and didn't know nearly enough of anything to solve it.

This is my **Redemption\Vengeance**.
